        <p>The Corona Virus lockdown began in March. We don't know how long it will last. I decided it would be healthy and productive to use this time to study new things. So far I've been working on html & css, and basic statistics. Html and css are used to create the webpages and links that make up the WWW(world wide web). I've been working in the Khan Academy education platform. The lessons are made up of short videos and then exercises to use new skills and knowledge.</p>

        <p>On April 1st I decided to start Khan's basic Stats course in addition to my work on html. The start of the Stat class has been very easy so far but I expect it to get more difficult as I continue. I'm doing this blog as a project for the html/css course.</p>

        <p>This blog is the final task in one unit of this html/css course. I wonder what the next unit will be like?</p>

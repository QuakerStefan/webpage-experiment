        <p>The Corona Virus lockdown began in March. We don't know how long it will last.<br> I decided it would be healthy and productive to use this time to study new things. So far I've been working on html & css, and basic statistics.<br> Html and css are used to create the webpages and links that make up the WWW(world wide web). I've been working in the Khan Academy education platform. The lessons are made up of short videos and then exercises to use new skills and knowledge.</p>

    <h2 id="Second post"></h2>
           
        
        <p>On April 1st I decided to start Khan's basic Stats course in addition to my work on html.<br> The start of the Stat class has been very easy so far but I expect it to get more difficult as I continue. I'm doing this blog as a project for the html/css course.</p>
    
    <h2>Third post</h2>
    <h2 id="Third post"></h2>
        
        <p>This blog is the final task in one unit of this html/css course. I wonder what the next unit will be like?<br> I've decided to switch to subject matter content. I don't think my musings are that interesting.<br> I've decide to add some info about local places to row.</p>
    
     <h2>Rowing on the Occoquan</h2>
    <h2 id="Rowing on the Occoquan"></h2>
        
        <p>The Occoquan reservoir is formed by a dam on the Occ. River, which Bull Run flows into<br> There are  4 rowing sites on the river/reservoir.<br>Lake Ridge Marina is a Prince William County parks facility, home to club rowing and hs teams. sandy Run Regional Park is in Fairfax Station and many teams & clubs row there.<br> Bull Run Marina is a smaller facility near Clifton, VA.There is also a small rowing site below the dam in Occoquan Regl Park.</p>

    <h2 id="Rowing on the Anacostia"></h2>
        <p>There are 2 locations to row on the Anacostia River. One is Capital Rowing Club in SW DC near Nationals Park.<br>The other is Bladensburg Park in PG County Maryland.<br> Several teams & clubs use each location.
